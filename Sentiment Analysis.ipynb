While Congress leaders say it is unfair to blame them because theirs is the “bigger party”, the fact remains that the party became overconfident after winning the three Hindi states and demanded more seats in Uttar Pradesh than the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party thought reasonable. After being left out of the alliance, the Congress decided to contest all 80 of Uttar Pradesh’s seats and brought in Priyanka Gandhi as a star campaigner. It is no more than an act of bravado, however. The party’s state leaders privately admit that they don’t even have strong candidates for all constituencies. “We should have focused on 10-15 seats,” said a state leader who asked not to be identified.\"\n",
